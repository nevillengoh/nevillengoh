Good afternoon Neville,

I received your application for the Dev Ops role here at Consilio and would welcome the opportunity to connect with you. Please let me know a few dates and times that work best for your schedule later this week and early next week and I'd love to find some mutual time to connect via phone.
I look forward to hearing from you and setting up a time to speak.
Best,
So we are waiting to hear from them and set up a date for interview
